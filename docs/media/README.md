# Media Assets

These stylised mock screenshots illustrate key game states. Replace them with actual captures before tagging the 1.0.0 release.

## Suggested Capture Flow
1. Launch the local build via `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. Use the browser's device toolbar to force a portrait viewport (~480x800).
3. Capture PNGs for menu, mid-run action, and game-over screens.
4. Export a short GIF (5-8 seconds) showcasing flap, meteor hit, and score pickup.
5. Overwrite the SVG mocks or add new PNG/GIF assets and update `readme.md` references.

Current placeholders are in SVG format plus a tiny animated GIF marker so that release tasks are tracked in git.
